Neuronal Spike Prediction (Computational Neuroscience)

This project implements a simple, interpretable model to predict whether a neuron will fire based on its recent spike history using logistic regression.

The goal is to understand **neural encoding** (how past activity influences future firing), not to maximize accuracy.

All analysis, explanations, and interpretations are inside the notebook.

Project Structure

How to run:
1. Install dependencies
2. Launch Jupyte
3. Open `notebook.ipynb` and run all cells from top to bottom.

Notes

- This is a baseline model focused on interpretability
- Accuracy is limited by sparse spike data and missing stimulus inputs
- Limitations and possible improvements are discussed in the notebook

Key Idea

Simple models are often more informative than complex ones in neuroscience, especially when biological interpretation matters.
